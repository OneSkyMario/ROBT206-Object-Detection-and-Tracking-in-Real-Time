# ROBT206-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-in-Real-Time
Real-time object detection and tracking: a YOLOv5-powered Python app captures people via USB camera, sends averaged 2D coords over serial to an Arduino Nano, which drives panâ€“tilt HS-225MG servos and a laser pointer in a 3D-printed mount, ensuring smooth, jitter-free target locking.
